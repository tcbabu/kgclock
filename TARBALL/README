# kgclock
Desktop analog clock for X Window System

kgclock also provides a alerts/notification system. Clock configuration
and alerts system can accessed through the clock menu. Clock menu will
pop-up on clicking at the clock center. The clock setup and atert system
are self explanatory (hopefully). Clarifications if any can be obtained
from the developer at tcbabu@gmail.com.
