Compositing Window Manager. Developed using Kulina Graphics Library for
LINUX, and designed using kgDevelop, a GUI application developer for
Linux. Kulina Graphics Library uses GraphicsMagick for image processing
and hence depends on GraphicsMagick and all dependencies of
GraphicsMagick. For audio alerts 'aplay' is required.
